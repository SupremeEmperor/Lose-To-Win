STARTING LEVEL 1 (for 1st time)

	???: Ahh... awake at last.
		 Thank you, young adventurer.

	RHEIN: Wh-Who's speaking?

	???: Oh, calm down. You've never heard of a sentient crown before?
		 Surely you knew of the treasures and majesty that awaited your successful plunder of this dungeon?
	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: The legend of the Crown of Kha'evos?

	RHEIN: I...

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: Well, why else did you come down here but for the riches and eternal glory I have offer?

	RHEIN: Riches? ... Eternal glory?

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: Yes, young one.
						And I only need one thing from you in return...
(slower, with a text effect)
						B L O O D.
(normal)
						Careful there, you're looking a little faint. Come on, it'll be fun!
						We'll go wreak havoc on the world! It'll be great!
						Just like old times, before I was so rudely, er, forgotten in this dungeon.
						Hey! Are you trying to put me back in the chest?
						That's rude, I thought we were bonding! And here I opened up to you!

	RHEIN: I'm not going to help you hurt people!
			Why can't I take you off!?

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: Hang on, that's not how this works.
						You made it to the end of the dungeon, you can't just say "no thanks" to your prize.

	RHEIN: You're no prize, you're a curse.

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: A curse? Is that what you think of me?
						Allow me to demonstrate what you could be with my help.

	RHEIN: No! I won't let you use me.

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: Oh, young adventurer...
						You don't have a choice.

	RHEIN: ... Yes, I do.
			I can give up my powers.
			I can prevent you from using my abilities for your gain.

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: You don't have the strength to resist me.




STARTING LEVEL 2

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: You're getting weaker, young adventurer.
						Think of all the progress you made.
						All the spells you learned, all the strength you gained... all for nothing.

	RHEIN: Shut up.

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: I can feel you fighting me. Stop fighting. Let go.
						Let me give you everything you've ever dreamed of.

	RHEIN: ...

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: Fine.
						Then you'll be trapped here forever, serving me whether you like it or not.



STARTING LEVEL 3

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: Your power dwindles, young adventurer.

	RHEIN: My name is Rhein, and I am still stronger than you.

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: Are you?



STARTING LEVEL 4

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: You must be scared, young one.

	RHEIN: ...

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: You have lost nearly half of your power.
						I could give it back, a hundred times over.



STARTING LEVEL 5

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: 

	RHEIN: 



LEAVING LEVEL 5 (END OF GAME)

	RHEIN: I told you I was stronger than you, even without my magic.
			I'm useless to you now.
			My magic is gone - I can no longer be your vessel.

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: NO!

	RHEIN: I understand now.
			This dungeon isn't meant to keep adventurers out...
			it's supposed to keep you in. It's your prison.
			And you will be trapped here for a very, very long time.

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: Think of the power, Rhein, the glory.
						Nations would fall at your feet. Mountains of gold, jewels, the finest wine.
						It could all be yours, Rhein, it could all be-

(Rhein exits. The crown flies back in the room and lands on the floor.)






BACKWARDS

	CROWN of KHA'EVOS: Yes, Rhein, feel yourself grow stronger.
						This is what we can do if we work together.

	RHEIN: No!
